        <p>Now at first glance, you might try to avert your eyes from his picture (Which is understandable), but if you look closely there are things you will notice and things you won't. The man you see the hardest working person you'll ever see. Not only is he the hardest working he is also the most intelligent person you'd meet in your life. This man is a man of all answers. No matter what the question is he will know the answer or find a way to figure it out which is something that is very rare for this day and age.</p>
        <p>Not only is he the hardest working intellectual person you'll see he is also the best father anyone could ever ask for. This man is a father who will put the family he loves way above anything else in his life. He will work days and nights nonstop to provide the absolute best for his family and knows what's best for his family. He has given a lot of knowledge to his kids especially his son. He might not realize it but his great son looks up to him in so many ways and has learned lots from him.</p>
